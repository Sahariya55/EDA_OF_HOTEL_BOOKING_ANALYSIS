        "\n",
        "3.Required Car Parking Spaces and Total Special Requests: There is a weak positive correlation between the number of required car parking spaces and the total number of special requests.

Furthermore, the distribution of transient-party guests underscores the distinct preferences and booking behaviors observed between city and resort accommodations, guiding tailored marketing strategies and service offerings to meet diverse guest needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The analysis reveals that short-term stays, spanning 1 to 3 nights, are prevalent across both city and resort hotels, reflecting common guest booking preferences.

        "\n",
        "8. The analysis underscores the dominance of Travel Agents/Tour Operators (TA/TO) as the primary distribution channel for bookings in both city and resort hotels, highlighting the significant role of third-party intermediaries in the hospitality industry. Additionally, direct bookings and corporate bookings contribute substantially to the distribution channels, indicating diverse booking sources for both types of hotels. However, the presence of a small number of bookings categorized as \"Undefined\" warrants further investigation to ensure data accuracy and understand any underlying factors influencing this category.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. The analysis reveals that in both city and resort hotels, the majority of bookings with \"No Deposit\" originate from the Online TA market segment, indicating a strong preference for this channel among guests who do not require deposits.

        "\n",
        "11. The analysis reveals that \"Bed & Breakfast\" is the preferred meal type for guests in both city and resort hotels, indicating a preference for meal-inclusive options. While \"Half Board\" is also popular, it is less favored compared to \"Bed & Breakfast.\" Interestingly, the \"Room Only\" option has fewer bookings in resort hotels compared to city hotels, suggesting that guests staying at resort accommodations may prioritize meal-inclusive packages. The presence of \"Undefined\" categories warrants further investigation to ensure accurate categorization and understand potential implications for guest preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. The analysis indicates that the City Hotel boasts a higher average daily rate (ADR) compared to the Resort Hotel on average. This finding suggests that the City Hotel has the potential to generate more revenue per room in comparison to the Resort Hotel. Such insights into revenue differentials between the two types of accommodations can inform strategic decisions regarding pricing strategies, marketing efforts, and resource allocation to optimize revenue generation for both hotels.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. The analysis of meal plan revenue reveals that Bed & Breakfast (BB) generates the highest revenue, followed by Half Board (HB) and Self Catering (SC), while Full Board (FB) generates the least revenue. Additionally, bookings categorized as \"Undefined\" also contribute to revenue. This insight underscores the importance of offering a diverse range of meal plans, particularly those with higher revenue potential like BB and HB, to maximize overall revenue generation. Such findings can guide strategic decisions regarding meal plan offerings and marketing strategies aimed at enhancing revenue optimization for the hotel.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. The analysis highlights that revenue from Online Travel Agents (TA) is the highest among all market segments, followed closely by Direct Bookings and Corporate Bookings. Group bookings also make a notable contribution to revenue, indicating the significance of group events or tours. While Offline Travel Agents (TA/TO) contribute significantly, revenue from Aviation and Complementary segments is comparatively lower. These insights emphasize the importance of online channels and direct bookings in revenue generation, alongside the significant contribution of corporate and group bookings.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. The analysis underscores the dominance of the TA/TO distribution channel in revenue generation, indicating a strong reliance on third-party travel agencies and tour operators. Direct bookings follow closely behind, making a significant contribution to overall revenue.

These insights emphasize the importance of strategic partnerships with travel agents and the direct booking channel in maximizing revenue for the hotel.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. The analysis reveals a clear seasonal pattern in cancellation rates, with higher rates during peak travel seasons and lower rates during off-peak periods.

This highlights the substantial impact of cancellations on the hotel's operations and revenue management. Understanding the factors contributing to cancellations and implementing strategies to mitigate their occurrence, such as flexible booking policies or targeted marketing efforts, could be crucial for optimizing revenue and enhancing overall operational efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. The analysis reveals varying cancellation patterns across different market segments. While the \"Groups\" segment exhibits the highest cancellation rate, other segments such as \"Online TA\" and \"Offline TA/TO\" also experience significant cancellations.

        "\n",
        "21.

        "\n",
        "25. The analysis highlights correlations between various factors impacting guest behavior and hotel operations. While lead time and previous cancellations exhibit a positive relationship, indicating potential booking patterns, weak correlations between booking changes, parking needs, and special requests suggest nuanced guest preferences.
